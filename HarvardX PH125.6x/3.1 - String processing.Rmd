Assessment: String Processing Part 1

#### **Question 1**  
Which of the following is NOT an application of string parsing?

- Removing unwanted characters from text.
- Extracting numeric values from text.
- Formatting numbers and characters so they can easily be displayed in deliverables like papers and presentations.    [*]
- Splitting strings into multiple values.

#### **Question 2**  
Which of the following commands would not give you an error in R?

- cat(" LeBron James is 6’8\" ")    [*]
- cat(' LeBron James is 6'8" ')
- cat(` LeBron James is 6'8" `)
- cat(" LeBron James is 6\’8" ")

#### **Question 3**  
Which of the following are advantages of the stringr package over string processing functions in base R? Select all that apply.

- Base R functions are rarely used for string processing by data scientists so it’s not worth learning them.
- Functions in stringr all start with “str_”, which makes them easy to look up using autocomplete.    [*]
- Stringr functions work better with pipes.   [*]
- The order of arguments is more consistent in stringr functions than in base R.   [*]

#### **Question 4**  
You have a dataframe of monthly sales and profits in R

```
> head(dat)
# A tibble: 5 x 3
Month     Sales     Profit 
<chr>     <chr>     <chr>  
January   $128,568  $16,234
February  $109,523  $12,876
March     $115,468  $17,920
April     $122,274  $15,825
May       $117,921  $15,437
```
Which of the following commands could convert the sales and profits columns to numeric? Select all that apply.

```
dat %>% mutate_at(2:3, parse_number)
```
```
dat %>% mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)
```
```
dat %>% mutate_all(parse_number)
```
```
dat %>% mutate_at(2:3, funs(str_replace_all(., c("\\$|,"), ""))) %>% 
    mutate_at(2:3, as.numeric)
``` [*]
