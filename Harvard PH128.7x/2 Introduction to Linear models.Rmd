Question 1

Why is the number of home runs considered a confounder of the relationship between bases on balls and runs per game?
- Home runs is not a confounder of this relationship.
- Home runs are the primary cause of runs per game.
- The correlation between home runs and runs per game is stronger than the correlation between bases on balls and runs per game.
- Players who get more bases on balls also tend to have more home runs; in addition, home runs increase the points per game.    [*]


Question 2

As described in the videos, when we stratified our regression lines for runs per game vs. bases on balls by the number of home runs, what happened?
- The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum was reduced because we removed confounding by home runs.   [*]
- The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum was reduced because there were fewer data points.
- The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum increased after we removed confounding by home runs.
- The slope of runs per game vs. bases on balls within each stratum stayed about the same as the original slope.


Question 3

We run a linear model for sons’ heights vs. fathers’ heights using the Galton height data, and get the following results:

```
 > lm(son ~ father, data = galton_heights)

Call:
lm(formula = son ~ father, data = galton_heights)

Coefficients:
(Intercept)    father  
    35.71       0.50  
```

Interpret the numeric coefficient for "father."
- For every inch we increase the son’s height, the predicted father’s height increases by 0.5 inches.
- For every inch we increase the father’s height, the predicted son’s height grows by 0.5 inches.   [*]
- For every inch we increase the father’s height, the predicted son’s height is 0.5 times greater.
