### Assessment: Baseball as a Motivating Example

#### **Question 1**  
What is the application of statistics and data science to baseball called?
- Moneyball
- Sabermetrics    [*]
- The “Oakland A’s Approach”
- There is no specific name for this; it’s just data science.

#### **Question 2**  

Which of the following outcomes is not included in the batting average?

- A home run
- A base on balls   [*]
- An out
- A single

#### **Question 3**  

Why do we consider team statistics as well as individual player statistics?
- The success of any individual player also depends on the strength of their team.   [*]
- Team statistics can be easier to calculate.
- The ultimate goal of sabermetrics is to rank teams, not players.


#### **Question 4**  

You want to know whether teams with more at-bats per game have more runs per game.

What R code below correctly makes a scatter plot for this relationship?

```
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001 ) %>%
    ggplot(aes(AB, R)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

```
[*]
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001 ) %>%
    mutate(AB_per_game = AB/G, R_per_game = R/G) %>%
    ggplot(aes(AB_per_game, R_per_game)) + 
    geom_point(alpha = 0.5)
```

```
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001 ) %>%
    mutate(AB_per_game = AB/G, R_per_game = R/G) %>%
    ggplot(aes(AB_per_game, R_per_game)) + 
    geom_line()
```

```
Teams %>% filter(yearID %in% 1961:2001 ) %>%
    mutate(AB_per_game = AB/G, R_per_game = R/G) %>%
    ggplot(aes(R_per_game, AB_per_game)) + 
    geom_point()
```
